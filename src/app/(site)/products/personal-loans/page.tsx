  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Personal loans have become a vital financial instrument for individuals seeking to manage their finances efficiently. Whether it’s consolidating debt, funding a significant purchase, or handling unexpected expenses, personal loans offer a flexible and accessible solution.
  </p>
  
  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What is a Personal Loan?</h3>
  
  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan provided by financial institutions, such as banks or online lenders, to individuals for various purposes. Unlike secured loans like a mortgage or car loan, personal loans do not require collateral. This means that the borrower does not need to provide an asset, such as a house or car, to secure the loan.
  </p>
  
  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    The amount you can borrow, the interest rate, and the repayment terms are typically based on your creditworthiness. The better your credit score, the more favorable the loan terms you'll likely receive.
  </p>
