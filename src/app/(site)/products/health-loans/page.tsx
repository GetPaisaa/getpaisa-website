  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Health loans have emerged as a crucial financial tool for individuals facing unexpected or substantial medical expenses. Whether it's covering the cost of surgery, ongoing treatment, or emergency medical care, health loans offer a flexible and accessible solution to manage healthcare-related costs.
  </p>
  
  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What is a Health Loan?</h3>
  
  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    A health loan is a type of personal loan specifically designed to cover medical expenses. Like other personal loans, health loans are typically unsecured, meaning they do not require collateral. This makes them accessible to a wide range of individuals who need financial assistance for medical purposes.
  </p>
  
  <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Health loans can be used for a variety of medical-related expenses, including hospital bills, surgeries, dental procedures, and even elective treatments that may not be covered by insurance. The loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms are usually determined based on the borrower’s creditworthiness.
  </p>
